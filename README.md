# 📦 Toaster

> Add a completely unnecessary, deeply satisfying toast-making mechanic to your Minecraft server.  
> Because sometimes… the bread deserves better.

## 🔥 What is this?

Toaster is a lightweight Spigot/Paper plugin that lets players **turn bread into toast**.  
Here’s how it works:

- Place **only bread** inside a chest.
- Right-click the chest with a **flint and steel**.
- If conditions are right, the bread transforms into "**Toast**" (renamed baked potato), sparks fly, a burp is heard, and the player gains **+1 heart**.

That’s it. No menus, no configs, just a hot slice of charm.

## 👨‍🍳 Why?

Because not everything has to be useful.  
Sometimes it just has to be funny, weird, or oddly delightful.

## 👀 Demo?

There’s really not much to show — it's a chest, some bread, and a dream.  
Check the code. Test it yourself. Tweak it if you'd like. That’s the joy of small code.
